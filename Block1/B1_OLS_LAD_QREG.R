#### Infant Mortality rates:   OLS and Quantile regression / LAD estimation ####
#    
#
# Example based on
# Wooldridge, Introductory econometrics, 5th ed., Example 9.10
#
# Model data:
# 
# 
#
#
#
#
# Data + basic plot
rm(list=ls())
load('infmrt.RData')
# Data description
desc
# We shall only use 1990 data
data <- data[data$year==1990,]
plot(data[,c(2,4,5,6)])
#
#
#
#
# Model specification
#
# log(infmort) = beta0 + beta1*log(pcinc) + beta2*log(physic)
#
#
# STEP 1 - Fit an OLS model
OLS.1 <- lm(infmort ~ log(pcinc) + log(physic) + log(popul), data)
summary(OLS.1)
plot(OLS.1, which = 4)
plot(OLS.1, which = 5)
#
# It seems that the observation "48" /D.C./ is an outlier & high leverage point...
#
# If we drop the outlier from regression, the model is estimated (using OLS) as follows
OLS.2 <- lm(infmort ~ log(pcinc) + log(physic) + log(popul), data = data[data$DC==0,])
summary(OLS.2)
# We can see that the coefficients differ significantly
#
# One way to identify/mitigate the problem is to address heteroscedasticity:
library(sandwich) # install.packages("sandwich")
library(lmtest) # install.packages("lmtest")
coeftest(OLS.1, vcov = vcovHC)
coeftest(OLS.2, vcov = vcovHC)
#
#
#
# STEP 2 - Use LAD / Quantile regression
#

summary(LAD.1)
summary(LAD.1, se="boot")
#
# The LAD also changes when DC is dropped from the dataset:
# + the change is lower when compared with OLS
# - LAD performs well on large datasets (asymptotic properties)

# Compare to LAD estimation with DC indluded:

#
#
#
#
# Quantile regression, use tau = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75
#
# Note that the following example is mostly for illustration purposes,
# as we only have 51 observations.

# summary plot
